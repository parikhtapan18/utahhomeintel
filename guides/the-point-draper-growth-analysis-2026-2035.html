<h1>The Point in Draper: What It Really Means for Utah Housing (2026–2035 Outlook)</h1>

<p style="font-size:14px; color:#6b7280;">
Last Updated: February 2026
</p>

<p>
The Point — the 600+ acre redevelopment of the former Utah State Prison site in Draper —
is one of the most significant long-term urban projects in Utah’s history.
Positioned between Salt Lake County and Utah County, it sits at the center of the Silicon Slopes corridor.
</p>

<p>
But what does this actually mean for relocation families, homeowners, and long-term investors?
This analysis separates structural impact from speculation.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What The Point Actually Is</h2>

<p>
The Point is planned as a mixed-use “15-minute city” concept including office space, housing,
retail, public transit access, and walkable commercial zones.
Its location near I-15 and the Draper Frontrunner station gives it regional connectivity.
</p>

<p>
However, large-scale developments move in phases. Full build-out could take a decade or more.
Short-term price spikes based purely on announcement headlines are unlikely to be sustainable.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Infrastructure Positioning</h2>

<p>
The Point sits near a rare infrastructure convergence:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I-15 north–south access</li>
<li>Bangerter Highway east–west expansion</li>
<li>Mountain View Corridor access to western Salt Lake Valley</li>
<li>Proximity to Draper Frontrunner station</li>
</ul>

<p>
Few residential areas in Utah sit within this triangle.
This matters more than marketing headlines.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Exposure Zones: Which Areas Benefit Most?</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Area</th>
<th>Commute to Lehi</th>
<th>Relative Pricing</th>
<th>Growth Exposure</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Draper</td>
<td>5–15 minutes</td>
<td>Premium</td>
<td>Direct adjacency to The Point</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Bluffdale</td>
<td>5–10 minutes</td>
<td>Moderate (discount to Draper)</td>
<td>High spillover potential</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Riverton</td>
<td>15–25 minutes</td>
<td>Moderate</td>
<td>Secondary benefit</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Herriman</td>
<td>20–30 minutes</td>
<td>Moderate</td>
<td>Western corridor growth</td>
</tr>
</table>

<hr>

<h2>Bluffdale: A Strategic Middle Position</h2>

<p>
Bluffdale sits at a rare convergence of I-15, Bangerter Highway, and Mountain View Corridor.
It is 5–10 minutes from the Lehi tech core and directly adjacent to Draper.
</p>

<p>
If Draper pricing increases due to The Point’s development,
Bluffdale could act as a “pressure release” market — offering Salt Lake County location
with comparatively lower entry pricing.
</p>

<p>
The city also benefits from:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Newer construction inventory</li>
<li>Modern schools</li>
<li>Family-oriented parks and splash pads</li>
<li>Salt Lake County services</li>
</ul>

<p>
That said, future appreciation depends on sustained job growth — not development headlines alone.

</p>

<h2>2034 Winter Olympics: Regional Catalyst, Not Guarantee</h2>

<p>
Salt Lake City is scheduled to host the 2034 Winter Olympics.
Historically, large global events accelerate infrastructure investment and increase national visibility.
</p>

<p>
Potential impacts include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Airport and transit improvements</li>
<li>Hospitality and commercial expansion</li>
<li>Temporary demand increases</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, Olympic-driven price surges are often temporary and uneven across micro-markets.
Long-term value is still determined by employment density and infrastructure fundamentals.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Who This Growth Thesis Fits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Relocation families planning 5+ year stays</li>
<li>Tech employees seeking commute efficiency</li>
<li>Buyers comfortable with phased development timelines</li>
<li>Long-term investors evaluating job-density growth</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Who Should Be Cautious</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short-term flippers expecting immediate appreciation</li>
<li>Buyers uncomfortable with ongoing construction zones</li>
<li>Those prioritizing established walkable downtown environments</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Strategic Takeaways (2026–2035)</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Point is a long-term structural project, not a short-term pricing catalyst.</li>
<li>Infrastructure convergence matters more than branding language.</li>
<li>Bluffdale represents a relative-value exposure play within Salt Lake County.</li>
<li>Draper remains premium but carries adjacency advantage.</li>
<li>Olympic exposure is secondary to sustained tech employment growth.</li>
</ul>
