<h1>Best Places to Live Near Silicon Slopes (Lehi Tech Corridor Guide 2026)</h1>

<p style="font-size:14px; color:#6b7280; margin-top:-10px;">
Last Updated: February 2026
</p>

<p>
Silicon Slopes has transformed Utah County and the southern<a href="salt-lake-county-guide.html">Salt Lake Valley </a>into one of the fastest-growing
tech corridors in the Mountain West. Companies such as Adobe, Qualtrics (legacy presence), and dozens of SaaS startups
have anchored long-term job growth in Lehi and surrounding cities.
</p>

<p>
    This guide is designed for professionals, relocating families, and long-distance movers evaluating where to live within commuting distance of the Lehi tech corridor.
</p>

<p>
Choosing where to live near Silicon Slopes is not simply about proximity. It is a structured decision balancing
commute exposure, housing inventory, long-term appreciation potential, lifestyle density, and infrastructure growth.
</p>

<hr style="margin:40px 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #e5e7eb;">

<h2>Who This Guide Is For</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tech professionals relocating for roles in Lehi or Draper</li>
  <li>Remote employees wanting access to the corridor</li>
  <li>Families balancing schools and commute</li>
  <li>Investors evaluating growth exposure near The Point development</li>
</ul>

<hr style="margin:40px 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #e5e7eb;">

<h2>Understanding The Growth Engine: Silicon Slopes & The Point</h2>

<p>
The Lehi tech corridor continues expanding north and south along I-15. A major long-term catalyst is 
<strong>The Point development in Draper</strong> — the former Utah State Prison site.
</p>

<p>
The Point is planned as a large-scale mixed-use “15-minute city” concept featuring residential, commercial,
office space, retail, and transit connectivity. Over the next 10–20 years, this area is expected to reshape
the Draper–Bluffdale corridor.
</p>

<p>
For relocation strategy, proximity to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>I-15</li>
  <li>Bangerter Highway</li>
  <li>Mountain View Corridor</li>
</ul>

<p>
will increasingly influence long-term value stability.
