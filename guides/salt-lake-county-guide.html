<p style="font-weight:600; margin-top:25px;">Methodology Note</p>
<p style="font-size:14px; color:#6b7280; margin-top:15px;">
    Data reflects 2026 market observations and average commute estimates under
    standard traffic conditions. School performance references publicly available
    district metrics and boundary zoning at time of writing.
</p>

<h2>Draper</h2>
<p>
Draper remains one of the most strategically positioned cities for professionals
working in Silicon Slopes while still maintaining proximity to Downtown SLC.
Commute times to Lehi are often under 15 minutes outside peak congestion.
</p>

<p>
Several Draper neighborhoods fall within high-performing public school boundaries,
and newer developments continue expanding family-oriented housing supply.
</p>

<p>
Outdoor access is a defining strength — trail systems, mountain biking routes,
and canyon access are integrated directly into residential zones.
</p>

<p>
Median pricing is typically higher than neighboring cities, reflecting demand,
growth trajectory, and limited buildable land.
</p>
<h3>Who Draper May Not Be Ideal For</h3>
<p>
Buyers seeking lower entry price points or more established tree-lined
neighborhoods may find better value in Sandy or Cottonwood Heights.
Draper’s newer developments typically reflect higher pricing per square foot.
</p>

<h2>South Jordan</h2>
<p>
More budget flexibility with strong freeway access. Suitable for families
balancing commute and suburban environment.
</p>

<h2>Cottonwood Heights</h2>
<p>
Strong ski proximity advantage. Established neighborhoods and stable property values.
</p>

<h2>Sandy</h2>
<p>
Sandy offers one of the most balanced relocation profiles in Salt Lake County.
It provides direct I-15 access, Trax connectivity, and consistent 20–25 minute
commute times to both Downtown Salt Lake City and Lehi tech corridor.
</p>

<p>
School performance across several Sandy and adjacent Draper zones is often
rated among the stronger public district options in the county, making it
appealing to families prioritizing education stability without moving too far south.
</p>

<p>
From a lifestyle perspective, Sandy provides immediate access to hiking
trailheads, Big and Little Cottonwood Canyon ski routes, major shopping centers,
fitness facilities, and diverse dining — most within a 10–15 minute drive.
</p>

<p>
Median pricing remains below Draper while still benefiting from similar
infrastructure access, making Sandy a strong value-to-location ratio candidate.
</p>
<h3>Who Sandy May Not Be Ideal For</h3>
<p>
Professionals seeking highly walkable, urban-style density may find Sandy too
suburban in layout. Those prioritizing ultra-close proximity to Downtown SLC
may prefer Sugar House or central neighborhoods instead.
</p>

<h2>Sugar House</h2>
<p>
Urban preference with close proximity to Downtown SLC. Higher density living.
